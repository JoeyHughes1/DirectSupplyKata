Hi!

Thank you for this opportunity! I went with the Quiz option.

For this, I learned C# from nothing (just Java experience), and I've never touched web development before, so I learned a lot about how and why websites and servers and clients and frontends and backends are structured and work the way they do. 
I learned a little React too (I wish I had time to learn more), and I learned a ton about how HTTP works and how web requests are structured and used. 
Also, I learned a ton about coding design, and how to structure a project like this.

So, what did I make?

In the folder marked (Old) you will find a command line interface for taking quizzes, including random quizzes taken from the Open Trivia Database. The backend has functionality for adding quizzes, removing quizzes, and editing quizzes too, but I never implemented them in the Command Line Interface.

The folder that says React Frontend has the same basic backend structure, but has an actual Web API for servicing HTTP requests for Quiz information and for adding/removing/editing quizzes. That took a lot of work to figure out and get working coming from the CLI. If you run it and use Swagger to make HTTP calls yourself, you could get full functionality.
Unfortunately, I didn't have time to make a fully working React interface. I was hoping to get to it, and it's a shame since I was really looking forward to learning more about React, but the most I got to was using it to test. The frontend as it is right now is just a page that displays a random Mythology quiz, giving away the correct answers.
The code for the frontend actually does do some hardcoded tests of adding a quiz, getting a quiz, editing a quiz, and removing a quiz, but that's all invisible to the user. It works, though!

So, in summary, I have a fully working Web API backend created! And, a testing React Interface as well that doesn't do much. Or, there's a Command Line Interface that actually does let you pick a category and quiz and take it, getting a score and everything.

I had a ton of fun learning all of this so quickly. I hope it shows off my love of learning, my ability to learn things quickly, and my ability to problem solve to get something working without sacrificing clarity and quality.

If you want to see more of how my mind works and my development process, I wrote down all of my thoughts in the Notes folder. I actually often like to have a document like that to organize all my thoughts by putting them to words and writing them down. So, you could read the Notes (and the Github commits and their descriptions, if you want) to follow along with the creation process.

Also, I used ChatGPT a lotttttt to ask clarifying questions on C# features and how things work with Web development (but not to write the code, I don't like doing that). If you want to see my (really long) chat with ChatGPT over the past 2 and a half days, you can look at it here, if you want: https://chatgpt.com/share/671f2bfe-b060-8005-80fd-983ff9ca8dd7

Thank you so much! I look forward to your thoughts and feedback!
